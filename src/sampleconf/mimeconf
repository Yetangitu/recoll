# Processing for the different mime types. There are different sections for
# decompression, 'interning' for indexing and preview, and external viewers

## These types need a first pass to create a temp file to work with. We use
# a script because uncompress utilities usually work in place, which is not
# suitable. The %t parameter will be changed to the name of a temporary
# directory by recoll. %f is the input file. rcluncomp will output the new
# file name on stdout, and you should do the same if you write another
# script (have a look at rcluncomp then).
application/x-gzip  =  uncompress rcluncomp gunzip %f %t
application/x-gzip  =  uncompress rcluncomp gunzip %f %t
application/x-bzip2 =  uncompress rcluncomp bunzip2 %f %t

## Indexing and internal preview
[index]
text/plain = internal 
text/html  = internal 
application/pdf = exec rclpdf
application/postscript = exec rclps

## External viewers
[view]
text/plain = xemacs %f
text/html = firefox -a firefox -remote "openFile(%u)"
application/pdf  = xpdf %f
application/postscript = gv %f
