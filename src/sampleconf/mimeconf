# Recoll : associations of mime types to processing filters.
# There are different sections for decompression, 'interning' for indexing
# and preview, and external viewers

## #######################################
# Decompression: these types need a first pass to create a temp file to
# work with. We use a script because uncompress utilities usually work in
# place, which is not suitable. 
#
# The %t parameter will be substituted to the name of a temporary directory
# by recoll. This directory is guaranteed empty when calling the filter
#
# The %f parameter will be substituted with the input file. 
#
# The script (ie: rcluncomp) must output the uncompressed file name on
# stdout. 
application/x-gzip  =  uncompress rcluncomp gunzip %f %t
application/x-compress = uncompress rcluncomp gunzip %f %t
application/x-bzip2 =  uncompress rcluncomp bunzip2 %f %t

## ###################################
# Filters for indexing and internal preview.
# The external (exec) filters  output the document in simple html format,
# have a look at the scripts.
