.TH RECOLL.CONF 5 "8 January 2006"
.SH NAME
recoll.conf \- main personal configuration file for Recoll
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file defines the indexation configuration for the full-text search
system Recoll.
.LP
The system-wide configuration file is normally located inside
/usr/[local]/share/recoll/examples. Any parameter set in the common file
may be overriden by setting it in the personal configuration file, by default:
.IR $HOME/.recoll/recoll.conf
.LP
Please note while we try to keep this manual page reasonably up to date, it
will frequently lag the current state of the software. The best source of
information about the configuration are the comments in the configuration
file.

.LP
A short extract of the file might look as follows:
.IP
.nf

# Space-separated list of directories to index.
topdirs =  ~/docs /usr/share/doc

[~/somedirectory-with-utf8-txt-files]
defaultcharset = utf-8

.fi
.LP
There are three kinds of lines: 
.RS
.IP \(bu
Comment or empty
.IP \(bu
Parameter affectation
.IP \(bu
Section definition
.RE
.LP
Empty lines or lines beginning with # are ignored.
.LP
Affectation lines are in the form 'name = value'.
.LP
Section lines allow redefining a parameter for a directory subtree. Some of
the parameters used for indexaction are looked up hierarchically from the
more to the less specific. Not all parameters can be meaningfully
redefined, this is specified for each in the next section.
.LP
The tilde character (~) is expanded in file names to the name of the user's
home directory.
.LP
Where values are lists, white space is used for separation, and elements with
embedded spaces can be quoted with double-quotes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "topdirs = "  directories
Specifies the list of directories to index (recursively). 
.TP
.BI "skippedNames = " patterns
A space-separated list of patterns for names of files or directories that
should be completely ignored. The list defined in the default file is:
.sp
.nf
*~ #* bin CVS  Cache caughtspam  tmp

.fi
The list can be redefined for subdirectories, but is only actually changed
for the top level ones in 
.I topdirs
.TP
.BI "skippedPaths = " patterns
A space-separated list of patterns for paths the indexer should not descend
into. Together with topdirs, this allows pruning the indexed tree to one's
content. daemSkippedPaths can be used to define a specific value for the
real time indexing monitor.
.TP
.BI "loglevel = " value
Verbosity level for recoll and recollindex. A value of 4 lists quite a lot of
debug/information messages. 3 lists only errors. 
.B daemloglevel
can be used to specify a different value for the real-time indexing daemon.
.TP
.BI "logfilename = " file
Where should the messages go. 'stderr' can be used as a special value.
.B daemlogfilename
can be used to specify a different value for the real-time indexing daemon.
.TP
.BI "dbdir = " directory
The name of the Xapian database directory. It will be created if needed
when the database is initialized. If this is not an absolute pathname, it
will be taken relative to the configuration directory.
.TP
.BI "indexstemminglanguages = " languages
A list of languages for which the stem expansion databases will be
built. See recollindex(1) for possible values.
.TP
.BI "defaultcharset = " charset
The name of the character set used for files that do not contain a
character set definition (ie: plain text files). This can be redefined for
any subdirectory.
.TP
.BI "maxfsoccuppc = " percentnumber
Maximum file system occupation before we
stop indexing. The value is a percentage, corresponding to
what the "Capacity" df output column shows.  The default
value is 0, meaning no checking.
.TP
.BI "idxflushmb = " megabytes
Threshold (megabytes of new text data)
where we flush from memory to disk index. Setting this can
help control memory usage. A value of 0 means no explicit
flushing, letting Xapian use its own default, which is
flushing every 10000 documents (memory usage depends on
average document size). The default value is 10.
.TP
.BI "filtersdir = " directory
A directory to search for the external filter scripts used to index some
types of files. The value should not be changed, except if you want to
modify one of the default scripts. The value can be redefined for any
subdirectory. 
.TP
.BI "iconsdir = " directory
The name of the directory where 
.B recoll
result list icons are stored. You can change this if you want different
images.
.TP
.BI "guesscharset = " boolean
Try to guess the character set of files if no internal value is available
(ie: for plain text files). This does not work well in general, and should
probably not be used.
.TP
.BI "indexallfilenames = " boolean
Recoll indexes file names into a special section of the database to allow
specific file names searches using wild cards. This parameter decides if
file name indexing is performed only for files with mime types that would
qualify them for full text indexation, or for all files inside
the selected subtrees, independant of mime type.
.TP
.BI "usesystemfilecommand = " boolean
Decide if we use the 
.B "file -i"
system command as a final step for determining the mime type for a file
(the main procedure uses suffix associations as defined in the 
.B mimemap 
file). This can be useful for files with suffixless names, but it will
also cause the indexation of many bogus "text" files.
