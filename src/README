Recoll

   Recoll is a personal full text search package for Linux, FreeBSD and other
   Unix systems. It is based on a very strong backend (Xapian), for which it
   provides an easy to use, feature-rich, easy administration interface.

   Recoll is free and copyrighted under the GPL license. A lot of the code is
   imported from other packages, see the Credits.

  Features:

     * QT-based GUI.
     * Supports the following document types (along with their compressed
       versions):

            Natively
                       * text.
                       * html.
                       * OpenOffice files.
                       * maildir and mailbox (Mozilla and Thunderbird mail
                         ok).
                       * gaim log files.

            With external helpers
                       * pdf with xpdf.
                       * postscript with ghostscript and pstotext.
                       * msword with antiword.
                       * rtf with unrtf.

     * Powerful query facilities, with boolean searches, phrases, filter on
       file types and directory tree.
     * Support for multiple charsets. Internal processing and storage uses
       Unicode UTF-8.
     * Stemming performed at query time (can switch stemming language after
       indexing)
     * Easy installation. No database daemon, web server or exotic language
       necessary.
     * An indexer which runs either as a thread inside the GUI or as an
       external, cron'able program.

   Recoll has been compiled and tested on FreeBSD, Linux, Darwin and Solaris
   (versions FreeBSD 5.3, Redhat 7.3, Solaris 8, but other not too distant
   releases should be ok too). You can download the source code here.

  Future evolutions

   Things hopefully coming in the not too far future (especially with some
   help):

     * Support for the more advanced Xapian concepts like relevance feedback.
     * An interactive configuration tool.
     * Rpms or other kinds of packages.
     * A more polished user interface with online help and better
       documentation.
     * More translations for the user interface.
     * A few more filters for less common file types.
     * Integration with the KDE desktop.

  Support

   If you have any kind of problem with the package or its installation,
   please e-mail me. I very much want to improve things, and can only do so
   if people will report problems. We shall set up a mailing list if the
   volume of questions increases.

   We also very much welcome functional suggestions or (gasp) code.

  Help wanted

   As might be obvious from the screenshots, Recoll needs some help from a
   better GUI designer.

  Credits

   Recoll borrows (steals?) heavily from the following projects. I tried to
   include the relevant copyright attributions with the code. Any omission is
   unintentional and will be fixed as soon as notified.

     * Xapian: The database module (core) is used unmodified, and quite a lot
       of code has been borrowed from Omega, the web-based search application
       (ie: the html parser, plus miscellaneous bits and ideas).
     * Estraier: Miscellaneous pieces of code and ideas, especially for
       charset handling, and code from external filters.
     * Unac: for accent removal. This is a relatively small package, not that
       easy to find, it has been integrated almost unmodified in the Recoll
       package.
     * Iconv, for character set conversion.
     * Binc IMAP for MIME parsing code.
     * I fear that bugs found elsewhere are mostly mine:
