  <h2>Recoll kio slave</h2>

  <p>Use this module to perform Recoll searches from any program with
    a KIO interface. <b>kio_recoll</b> is primarily
    designed and tested with <b>konqueror</b>, and you will
    undoubtedly get even more surprising effects with other tools.</p>

  <p>The module can work in two modes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Html interface</b>, close to a simplified QT Recoll
      interface.</li>
    <li><b>File manager interface</b>, which presents results as
      directory entries</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The module is still in its infancy. You will undoubtedly obtain
    strange effects from time to time. If you have any remarks or
    ideas about improving kio_recoll, or observe an interesting and
    reproducible sequence, please <a href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org">
    report it</a>.</p>

  <p>The module is particularly unhelpful with search hits inside
    email folders, which Konqueror has no way to access.</p>


  <h3>HTML interface</h3>

  <p>This works more or less like the Recoll QT GUI, much simplified. The 
    <a href="http://www.recoll.org/usermanual/rcl.search.lang.html">
      Recoll manual</a> describes the queries that can be performed.</p> 

  <p>Most pages in the interface should quite self-explanatory.</p>

  <p>You normally enter this interface by entering "recoll:" or
    "recoll:/" in the Konqueror URL entry, and following the "search"
    link.<br>  In most circumstances, entering a link like
    "recoll:/some search terms" will also yield an HTML result
    list.</p>


  <h3>File manager interface</h3>

  <p>Search results are returned as directory entries. No search
    result details (samples, relevance etc.) are available, but this
    interface allows multiple selections and copies, usage inside any
    KDE open dialog, etc.</p>

  <p>The <i>path</i> part of the URI is taken as a Recoll query
    language string and executed. The results are displayed as
    directory entries.</p>

  <p>To avoid swamping the interface with thousands of results, the
    result count is limited to 100 by default. You can change this value
    by setting the <code>kio_max_direntries</code> parameter in your recoll
    configuration file (typically ~/.recoll/recoll.conf)</p>

  <p>There are several ways to enter this interface:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using "recollf" as protocol name instead of "recoll". This is
      probably the easiest option inside open dialogs.</li>

    <li>Using an URL ending with a&nbsp;'/', ie:
      <blockquote><i>recoll:/red apples ext:.html/</i></blockquote></li>

    <li>Switching from the HTML interface in konqueror by clicking the
      "Directory&nbsp;view" link at the top of the page. When doing
      this, the directory content will be synchronized with the
      current HTML result page. This offers a way to display results
      in the file manager beyond the <code>kio_max_direntries</code>
      limit. <em>In most cases, you will have to reload the file
      manager page to obtain this synchronization</em>.</li>

    <li>Users who will want to use the file manager view most of the
      time can set the <code>RECOLL_KIO_ALWAYS_DIR</code> environment
      variable or the <code>kio_always_dir</code> recoll.conf variable
      to&nbsp;1. The HTML interface will then only be accessible
      through the search link in the top "recoll:" view.</li>
  </ul>
