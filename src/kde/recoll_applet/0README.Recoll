This directory contains a modified version of the find_applet, a KDE kicker
applet designed to start a text search process. Original location:
     http://demandiseineseite.gmxhome.de/find/

The only interesting files are src/recoll_applet.cpp and src/recoll_applet.h,
all the rest is standard unmodified kde boilerplate.

The applet was modified to start a Recoll search instead of a
Konqueror/kio_find/tracker one.

See the AUTHORS and COPYING files for the unchanged copyright information.
