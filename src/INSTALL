                        4.1. Installing a prebuilt copy

   Recoll binary installations are always linked statically to the xapian
   libraries, and have no other dependencies. You will only have to check or
   install supporting applications for the file types that you want to index
   beyond text, html and mail files.

4.1.1. Installing through a package system

   If you use a BSD-type port system or a prebuilt package (RPM or other),
   just follow the usual procedure, and maybe have a look at the
   configuration section (but this may not be necessary for a quick test with
   default parameters).

4.1.2. Installing a prebuilt Recoll

   The unpackaged binary versions are just compressed tar files of a build
   tree, where only the useful parts were kept (executables and sample
   configuration).

   The executable binary files are built with a static link to libxapian and
   libiconv, to make installation easier (no dependencies). However, this
   also means that you cannot change the versions which are used.

   After extracting the tar file, you can proceed with installation as if you
   had built the package from source (that is, just type make install). The
   binary trees are built for installation to /usr/local.

   You may then need to install external applications to process some file
   types that you want indexed (ie: acrobat, postscript ...). See next
   section.

   Finally, you may want to have a look at the configuration section.

                  4.2. Packages needed for external file types

   Recoll uses external applications to index some file types. You need to
   install them for the file types that you wish to have indexed (these are
   run-time dependencies. None is needed for building Recoll):

     * PDF: pdftotext is part of the Xpdf package.

     * Postscript: pstotext.

     * MS Word: antiword.

     * MS Excel and PowerPoint: catdoc.

     * RTF: unrtf

     * dvi: dvips

     * djvu: DjVuLibre

     * MP3: Recoll will use the id3info command from the id3lib package to
       extract tag information. Without it, only the filenames will be
       indexed.

   Text, Html, mail folders and Openoffice files are processed internally.

                           4.3. Building from source

4.3.1. Prerequisites

   At the very least, you will need to download and install the xapian core
   package (Recoll development currently uses version 0.9.5), and the qt
   runtime and development packages (Recoll development currently uses
   version 3.3.5, but any 3.3 version is probably ok).

   You will most probably be able to find a binary package for qt for your
   system. You may have to compile Xapian but this is not difficult (if you
   are using FreeBSD, there is a port).

   You may also need libiconv. Recoll currently uses version 1.9 (this should
   not be critical). On Linux systems, the iconv interface is part of libc
   and you should not need to do anything special.

4.3.2. Building

   Recoll has been built on Linux (redhat7.3, mandriva 2005, Fedora Core 3),
   FreeBSD and Solaris 8. If you build on another system, I would very much
   welcome patches.

   Depending on the qt configuration on your system, you may have to set the
   QTDIR and QMAKESPECS variables in your environment:

     * QTDIR should point to the directory above the one that holds the qt
       include files (ie: qt.h).

     * QMAKESPECS should be set to the name of one of the qt mkspecs
       subdirectories (ie: linux-g++).

   On many Linux systems, QTDIR is set by the login scripts, and QMAKESPECS
   is not needed because there is a default link in mkspecs/.

   The Recoll configure script does a better job of checking these variables
   after release 1.1.1. Before this, unexplained errors will occur during
   compilation if the environment is not set up. Also, for 1.1.0 the qmake
   command should be in your PATH (later releases can also find it in
   $QTDIR/bin).

   Normal procedure:

         cd recoll-xxx
         configure
         make
         (practises usual hardship-repelling invocations)
     

   There little autoconfiguration. The configure script will mainly link one
   of the system-specific files in the mk directory to mk/sysconf. If your
   system is not known yet, it will tell you as much, and you may want to
   manually copy and modify one of the existing files (the new file name
   should be the output of uname -s).

4.3.3. Installation

   Either type make install or execute recollinstall prefix, in the root of
   the source tree. This will copy the commands to prefix/bin and the sample
   configuration files, scripts and other shared data to prefix/share/recoll.

   If the installation prefix given to recollinstall is different from what
   was specified when executing configure, you will have to set the
   RECOLL_DATADIR environment variable to indicate where the shared data is
   to be found.

   You can then proceed to configuration.
