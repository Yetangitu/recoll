                           4.1. Building from source

4.1.1. Prerequisites

   At the very least, you will need to download and install the xapian core
   package (Recoll currently uses version 0.9.2), and the qt runtime and
   development packages (Recoll currently uses version 3.3.3).

   You will most probably be able to find a binary package for qt for your
   system. You may have to compile Xapian, but this is not difficult (if you
   are using FreeBSD, there is a port).

   You may also need libiconv. Recoll currently uses version 1.9 (this should
   not be critical). On Linux systems, the iconv interface is part of libc
   and you should not need to do anything special.

   External file types. Recoll uses external applications to index some file
   types. You need to install them for the file types that you wish to have
   indexed:

     * MS Word: antiword.

     * PDF: pdftotext is part of the Xpdf package.

     * Postscript: pstotext.

     * RTF: unrtf

4.1.2. Building

   Recoll has been built on Linux (redhat7.3, mandriva 2005, Fedora Core 3),
   FreeBSD and Solaris 8. If you build on another system, I would very much
   welcome patches.

   Depending on the qt configuration on your system, you may have to set the
   QTDIR and QMAKESPECS variables in your environment:

     * QTDIR should point to the directory above the one that holds the qt
       include files (ie: qt.h).

     * QMAKESPECS should be set to the name of one of the qt mkspecs
       subdirectories (ie: linux-g++).

   On many Linux systems, QTDIR is set by the login scripts, and QMAKESPECS
   is not needed because there is a default link in mkspecs/.

   The Recoll configure script does a better job of checking these variables
   after release 1.1.1. Before this, unexplained errors will occur during
   compilation if the environment is not set up. Also, for 1.1.0 the qmake
   command should be in your PATH (later releases can also find it in
   $QTDIR/bin).

   Normal procedure:

         cd recoll-xxx
         configure
         make
         (practises usual hardship-repelling invocations)
     

   There little autoconfiguration. The configure script will mainly link one
   of the system-specific files in the mk directory to mk/sysconf. If your
   system is not known yet, it will tell you as much, and you may want to
   manually copy and modify one of the existing files (the new file name
   should be the output of uname -s).

4.1.3. Installation

   Either type make install or execute recollinstall targetdir, in the root
   of the source tree. This will copy the commands to $targetdir/bin and the
   sample configuration files, scripts and other shared data to
   $targetdir/share/recoll.
