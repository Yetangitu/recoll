Installation instructions:

Installing a binary package:
----------------------------
The binary packages are statically linked and should install real easy
(hopefully). There are no rpm or other managed packages for now.

 - Unpack the tar file. Will create a recoll-x.y directory
 - Arrange to have the recoll-x.y/bin directory in your PATH, or copy/link the
   'recoll' executable where it will be found.

 - Copy the files from the sampleconf directory somewhere. The default
   location is $HOME/.recoll/ If you choose another location, you will have
   to set the RECOLL_CONFDIR environment variable.

 - Possibly adjust the recoll.conf file. The default should be fine for
   trying in most cases.
 - Possibly adjust the mimeconf file, especially the external viewer
   section, depending on what you are using (ie acrobat vs xpdf, etc...)

 - Start the 'recoll' program. After displaying a dialog, it will normally
   begin to index the directories specified in recoll.conf.

Building from source
--------------------

Prerequisites:

To build from source, you need the following packages. Except if you're
using a really strange system, you can probably easily find, or already
have, a precompiled version of iconv, and maybe qt.

    - qt and qt-devel (www.trolltech.com). Currently using 3.3.3
    - xapian-core  (www.xapian.org). Currently using 0.8.5
    - libiconv (http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/). Currently using 1.9,

Building:
 
There is no autoconf for now. You need to chose a file in the mk directory,
and link it into a file named 'sysconf' there. If your system is not
supported by the supplied files, it should be easy enough to build a new
one from the examples (then send it to me please).

You also need to adjust the recoll.pro file inside the qtgui directory to
fix the "-L/usr/local/lib -lxapian -liconv" piece, depending on where your
libs are installed.

Then cd to the top directory, and type make.
