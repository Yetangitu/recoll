      <h2><a name="source">General information</a></h2>

      <p>You will probably need to have a look at the
	<a href="usermanual/rcl.install.html">installation manual</a> for
	building and/or installation instructions.</p>

      <p><i>For building from source</i>, you will need a xapian-core
	installation. You will find source and binary packages on  the 
	<a href="http://www.xapian.org/download.php">Xapian download
	  page</a>. Recoll 1.10.2 should build with any 0.9.x or 1.0.x
	  Xapian version (the current one is 1.0.5).</p>

      <p>You need Qt 3.3 (or qt 4) in all cases. Recoll will
	automatically be configured to build with qt4 if the version
	of qmake found in $QTDIR/bin:$PATH is for qt4.</p>

      <p>QT 4.4 note (2008-05-23): there seems to be a few problems in
	Qt 4.4.0 (maybe in the qt3 compatibility layer), resulting in
	problems in displaying the Recoll result list. I suggest
	avoiding qt 4.4 with Recoll for now (qt 4.3 works fine).</p>

      <p>Recoll relies on external packages for some
	of its functionality (ie: for many of the non-text file
	types). These are not listed as strict dependencies, because
	the base application can be sufficient in some cases, but you
	should have a look at the 
	<a href="usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.INSTALL.EXTERNAL">list</a> to
	decide what you may want to install.</p>

      <p>In addition, optional functionality in Recoll (the term explorer
	tool in phonetic mode) uses the <b>aspell</b> package. The
	installed version should be at least 0.60 (utf-8 support) for
	this to run smoothly. This function is far from essential.</p>

      <p>If you find problems with this page, the package or its
	installation, <em>please</em> 
	<a href="mailto:jean-francois.dockes@wanadoo.fr">
	  report them</a>.</p>

      <p>The download page for the previous 1.9 version is still 
	<a href="download-1.9.html">here</a></p>

      <h3>What do the release numbers mean?</h3>

      <p>The Recoll releases are numbered X.Y.Z. </p>

      <p>The first number would only change for really major
	modifications like a big change in the index format. It is
	quite possible that X will not actually ever change.</p>
      <p>The second number (Y) is for functional
	modifications. These may bring bugs, so if you're satisfied
	with the previous version, and don't need the new features,
	you may want to wait a little, and especially skip the first
	release (X.Y.0), at least for a few weeks.</p>
      <p>The third number (Z) changes for bug fixes. A maintenance
	branch is kept for each X.Y version, and we try to make
	minimal changes on this. So, moving from X.Y.Z to X.Y.Z+u
	should in general involve little risk of regression. But,
	<em>any</em> change can bring problems, if you are not
	affected by the corrected bugs (check the <a
	href="CHANGES.txt">changes file</a>), there is probably no
	necessity to upgrade anyway.</p>

      <h2><a name="filters">Updated filters</a></h2>

      <p>New and updated filters are sometimes 
	<a href="filters/filters.html">available</a> before the next
	Recoll release. There are no updated filters for Recoll
	1.10.2, but you may find some if you are running an older
	release.</p>


      <h2><a name="source">Source</a></h2>

      <p><b>Current version:</b> 

	<p>1.10.2: <a href="recoll-1.10.2.tar.gz">recoll-1.10.2.tar.gz</a>
	  See the <a href="BUGS.txt">known bugs and issues</a> and 
	  <a href="CHANGES.txt">changes</a>.</p>

      <p>Recoll 1.10 will work with Xapian versions 0.9.x or 1.0.x but
	1.0 is preferred. In order to take advantage of the new index
	format in Xapian 1.0, Recoll users updating from 1.8 or older,
	or who have skipped this step for 1.9 need to delete their old index. 
	<a href="xapUpg100.html">More details</a>. 
	This is not mandatory, and the old index format will continue
	working just as before (but it is slower, and has a few bugs
	fixed in 1.0).<em>You don't need to do this if you did it
	  for Recoll 1.9</em></p>

      <p>If updating from 1.8 or older, and you had turned off the
	mime type icons inside the result lists in your current Recoll
	version, you need to do a small manual adjustment in 1.9/1.10
	to achieve the same effect. See the first entry in
	the <a href="CHANGES.txt">changes</a> list.</p>

      <p>Older recoll releases:
	<a href="recoll-1.10.1.tar.gz">1.10.1</a>.
	<a href="recoll-1.10.0.tar.gz">1.10.0</a>.
	<a href="recoll-1.9.0.tar.gz">1.9.0</a>.

      </p>

      <p>A separate source file contains a KDE kicker applet to start
	a Recoll search from the KDE toolbar: 
	<a href="recoll_applet-1.10.0.tgz">recoll_applet-1.10.0.tgz</a>.
	This is a very slightly modified version of the 
	<a href="http://demandiseineseite.gmxhome.de/find/">
	  find_applet.</a></p>

      <h2><a name="rpms">Packages</a></h2>

      <p>The executables inside the binary rpms have a static link to
	xapian 1.0.4/5, there is no real dependency except Qt 3.3. 
	The Fedora and Mandriva packages unfortunately think that they
	depend on exiftool (which is needed by the little
	used jpeg info filter), due to excessive rpmbuild
	cleverness.
	<br>
	Of course you need xapian-core installed to use the source
	rpms. </p>

      <p><b>Debian unstable</b> Recoll is in the package repository,
	you can install it with the usual <em>apt-get install recoll</em>.

      <h2><a name="otherbinary">Binary bundles</a></h2>

      <p>These are just prebuilt trees (without the source files).
	The executables were built with xapian 1.0.5 (patched for the
	NEAR bug) and libiconv 1.9.2 (where relevant) as static
	libraries. They depend on qt 3.3. For Solaris, you should be
	able to find a qt package 
      <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">here</a>.</p> 

      <p>The installation instructions are <a
        href="usermanual/rcl.install.binary.html"> there</a>.</p>

      <p><span class="application">FreeBSD</span> 6.3 i386: 
	<a href="freebsd/recoll-1.10.2-FreeBSD-6.3-STABLE.tgz">

      </p>

      <p><span class="application">Solaris 8</span> sparc. 
      Note to Solaris users: you need to perform the initial
      indexing pass with "recollindex", not the recoll GUI indexing
      thread. See <a href="BUGS.txt">errata</a>.
      <a href="sunos/recoll-1.10.2-SunOS-5.8.tgz">
        recoll-1.10.2-SunOS-5.8.tgz</a>.

      <p>Recoll also builds and runs on Solaris 10, but, given the
	situation of open source packages for Solaris (very old qt on
	the Companion CD, inconsistent versions of the compiler and
	non-threaded version of qt on sunfreeware), I've come to the
	temporary conclusion that you are better off building than
	trying to install packages. The approach I recently tried and
	which worked was to:
	<ul>
	  <li>Install gcc 3.4.6 and gnu make from the sunfreeware 
	    packages (go to /usr/local). I guess that the gcc in
	    /usr/sfw should be ok too here.</li>
	  <li>Compile xapian-core and install it (with prefix
	    /usr/local).</li>
	  <li>Configure and install qt. The following config worked for me,
	    with qt 3.3.8:
<pre>
./configure -platform solaris-g++ -prefix /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-3.3.8/ -thread
</pre>
           Then make. Weirdly, I had to add the qt build lib/
           directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH at some point during the
           build).
	  </li>
	  <li>Set QTDIR=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-3.3.8 and 
	    QMAKESPEC=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-3.3.8/mkspecs/solaris-g++
	    and add $QTDIR/bin to the PATH then configure, make and
	    install Recoll</li>
	  <li>Don't forget to use recollindex for the first index
	    build, recoll does not work for this (exception handling
	    mystery probably).</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
      <p>Obviously, there are other ways to do it (use CC, install
	some place else ... ), but I tried this one.</p> 


      <h2><a name="ports">FreeBSD ports</a></h2> 

      <p>There are ports for both xapian-core
	and recoll in the standard tree, you may just need to update
	your ports (cvsup, portsnap), or you can get the ports from
	the FreeBSD site. The ports are not updated for the xapian
	NEAR problem though.

	  xapian port</a> 
	<a href="http://cvsweb.freebsd.org/ports/deskutils/recoll">
	  recoll port</a>.</p>

      <h2><a name="translations">Translations</a></h2>

      <p>Some of the translations for 1.10 are incomplete. The source
	translation files are included in the source release. If your
	language has some english messages left and you want to take a
	shot at fixing the problem, you can send the results to
	<a href="mailto:jean-francois.dockes@wanadoo.fr">me</a> and
	earn my gratefulness (and your less multilingual
	compatriot's)...</p>

      <p>You can use the <em>.ts</em> file to alter the translations if you
	wish (use QT's <em>linguist</em> tool to edit the source file,
	then <em>lrelease</em> to produce the <em>.qm</em> file.).
	The <literal>.qm</literal> file should be copied to 
	<span class="filename">/usr/[local/]share/recoll/translations</span>
      </p>

      <p><a href="translations/recoll_xx.ts">recoll_xx.ts</a> is a blank
