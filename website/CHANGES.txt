CHANGES 

Updating from 1.2 to 1.3 or 1.4 or 1.5: 
---------------------------------------
From version 1.3 up, there is a new feature to search specifically for file
names (with wildcard processing). If you want to take full advantage of
this, you should perform a full reindex after installing the new version
(ie: use recollindex -z, or delete ~/.recoll/xapiandb).
Also, we now use the central copies of configuration files for default
values, and the user ones only for overrides. Your old configuration files
will still work, but, you may want to remove them if they are unmodified,
or keep only the modified parameters.

1.5.0 2006-09-20

- Added support for powerpoint and excel files, with the catdoc package.
- Allow viewing consecutive documents from the result list inside a single
  preview window using the shift-arrow-up and shift-arrow-down keys.
- Colorize search terms in abstracts in the result list.
- A number of elements are now remembered between program invocations:
  sort criteria, list of ignored file types (always starts inactive), 
  subtree restriction, better handling of the recent searches listbox, the
  buildAbstract and replaceAbstract settings are not forgotten any more.
- New option to automatically add a phrase to simple searches.
- Possibility to adjust the length and context width for synthetic abstracts.
- Handle weird html better.
- When indexing mail messages, walk the full mime tree instead of staying
  at the top level, index all text parts and attachement file names.
- Add -c <confdir> option to recoll and recollindex to specify the
  configuration directory on the command line
- Better synchronization between the active preview and the highlighted
  paragraph inside the list
- Improved recall for some special cases of stemming.
- Much better handling of email dates, allowing better email sorting by
  date (previously the message date was quite often the date when the file
  was indexed).
- Store the external database lists in the configuration directory, not the
  qt preferences.
- Ensure dialogs are sized according to font size


1.4.3 2006-05-07
 - Multiple search databases. 
 - Optionally auto-search when a word is entered in the simple search
   field.
 - Show possible term completions in simple search by typing CTRL+TAB
 - Add 'more like this' option to result list right-click menu, to look for
   documents related to the current result.
 - Double-click in preview or result list adds the selected word to the
   simple search text field.
 - The simple search text entry field is now a combobox and remembers
   previous searches.
 - Additional OR field in complex search.
 - Improved indexing cancellability (interrupting recollindex or closing 
   recoll with an indexing thread active), and status reporting.
 - Fixed filters to handle file paths with embedded spaces.
 - Misc small bug and memory leaks fixes.
 - More compact result list.
 - Set mode 0700 on .recoll directory by default

1.3.3 2006-04-04
 - Implement specific search on file names with wildcard
   support. Indexation can optionally process all file names or only those
   with mime types supported for normal indexation. UPDATING: you need a
   full re-indexation to take advantage of this.
 - Use links and a right-click popup menu to replace confusing use of
   mouse clicks and double-clicks inside the result list.
 - The 'example' configuration files are now used as default, and are not
   copied any more to the user directory during installation. Overrides can
   be set in the personal files for any value that the user wishes to
   modify, with unchanged formats and file names (so that the files from
   previous versions remain valid, but you may wish to trim them of values
   that duplicate the central ones).
 - Use NLS information (LC_CTYPE, LANG) do determine default charset when
   possible.
 - Mp3 file indexing, either filenames only or also id3 tags if id3info is
   available. c/c++  ext edit. Use gnuclient instead of xemacs for text files.
 - Russian and Ukrainian translations and many improvement ideas thanks to
   Michael Shigorin.

1.2.3 2006-03-03
 - Added support for dvi (with dvips), and dvu (with DjVuLibre).
 - Ensure that configure and make use the same qt version.
 - Fix sorted sequence title display.
 - Discriminate fatal errors and missing docs while loading a doc list.
 - Improved and cleaned up way to position a preview on the first search term.
1.2.2 2006-02-02
 - Fix minor compilation glitches (FreeBSD 4, QT 3.1, xapian-config problem)
1.2.0 2006-02-01
 - Improved preview loading: don't highlight very big documents (over 1Mb),
   allow cancellation while loading.
 - Abstracts generated in the result list by looking at search term
   contexts. This can slow down result list display for big documents, and
   can be turned off in the preferences menu.
 - Wrap query detail line displayed when clicking on result list header.
 - Text splitting cleanup with less spurious terms should result in
   slightly smaller databases.
 - Sligthly improved presentation in preview, esp. line breaks.
 - Color icons...
 - Let the user select the html browser used for help display.
 - autoconf/Makefile change: allow building UI from inside the qtgui
   directory. 
 - autoconf/Makefile: improved search and diagnostics for qt/qmake.
 - Internal code cleanup for maintainability: text splitting, user
   interface.
 - Added prototype kio_slave to show result inside Konqueror, doesn't seem
   particularly useful.
1.1.0 2006-01-12
 - A much better user manual, which can be browsed from the help menu.
 - man pages for recoll, recollindex, recoll.conf
 - User/query interface configuration dialog.
 - Click on result list header will display the exact boolean search which
   was used.
 - recollindex can be used to create stem expansion databases independantly
   of a full indexing pass.
 - Misc user interface improvements, like an 'all terms' checkbox for
   simple search.
 - Fixed case-insensitivity issues. Probably needs more testing.
1.0.16 2006-01-05
 - Minor installation tweaks for rpm compatibility
1.0.15 
 - Fix problems with prefix != /usr/local
 - Remove '.*' from the default list of ignored file/dir names: this
   prevented mozilla/thunderbird mail indexing. 
 - Fix some 64 bits issues
1.0.14
 - Small changes for FreeBSD 4 compilation.
1.0.13
 - Install of recollinstall program not done or needed any more.
1.0.12
 - Fixed nasty html parsing bug introduced in 1.0.9 Html parsing failed
   whenever the document charset name differed from the default only in 
   character case or punctuation.
1.0.11
 - Create personal configuration on first start.
 - Use qt toolbars.
 - Also index terms in file paths.
 - Tool for sorting on dates or mime types.
 - Fixed pdf filter which was broken by more recent xpdf
 - Filters now installed/executed from /usr/local

1.0.10
 - Added tool to manage the history of consulted documents.
 - Try harder to convert email messages with wrongly declared charsets.
 - Add option to reset the database before indexing (easier than rm -rf).
 - Small gui improvements.
 - Install partial french translation as a tease for future translaters...

1.0.8->1.0.9
 - Fixed 2 really ennoying bugs in 1.0.8: wouldn't preview 2nd document
   from same file + spurious db close when filter could not be executed.

1.0.5 -> 1.0.8
 - Add support for rtf and gaim logs
 - Optionally show icons to indicate mime types in result list
 - Better (but imperfect) feedback during the preview loading for big files
 - Remember main window geometry when closing
 - Fix stem expansion in advanced search
 - Some autoconf
 - Option to use the system's 'file' command as a final step of
   identification for suffix-less or unknown files.
 - Typo had removed support for .Z compression
 - Use more appropriate conjonction operators when computing the advanced
   search query (OP_AND_MAYBE, OP_FILTER instead of OP_AND)
